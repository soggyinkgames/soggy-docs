{/* vfx description */}
Inspired by André-Marie Ampère, the first scientist to attempt to theoretically explain and mathematically describe electricity and magnetism. These are glowing electric particles come together in any desired shape (sdf) and the color shifts magnetically as the user moves around it changing their viewing position in real time.

{/* inventor story*/}
    <Card title="Ampere" icon="rocket">
    Although he was not the first person to observe a connection between electricity and magnetism, André-Marie Ampère was the first scientist to attempt to theoretically explain and mathematically describe the phenomenon. His contributions laid the groundwork upon which the science of electrodynamics (a term coined by Ampère, but now more commonly referred to as electromagnetics) has been built.
