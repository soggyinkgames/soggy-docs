{/* vfx description */}
Inspired by Vera Rubin, who's work showed that galaxies are rotating much faster than they should be, which led to the discovery of dark matter. A portal that explodes upon instantiation, centering a rotating swirl, in a circular glowing entrance as well as a intergalactic cone of linearly moving particles behind the swirl, that allow the user to feel immediately transported as they walk through it.
