{/* vfx description */}
Inspired by German physicist Wilhelm Weber, who developed and enhanced a variety of devices for sensitively detecting and measuring magnetic fields and electrical currents. This is another user controlled vfx orb displaying a glow and electric like strips expanding from the centre of the orb with pulsating waves of particles, all moving together as the user moves their hands to various transform positions.

{/* inventor story*/}
    <Card title="Weber" icon="rocket">
    Researching magnetism with the great mathematician and astronomer Karl Friedrich Gauss in the 1830s, German physicist Wilhelm Weber developed and enhanced a variety of devices for sensitively detecting and measuring magnetic fields and electrical currents. Included among these devices was the electrodynamometer, which was capable of measuring electric current, voltage or power through the interaction of the magnetic fields of two coils. Utilizing this device, Weber experimentally validated André-Marie Ampère’s force law. Weber began developing a similar system of electric units around 1840 after Gauss developed a system of magnetic units expressed in terms of length, mass and time in the early 1830s.
