{/* vfx description */}
Inspired by Sau Lan Wu, an experimental physicist who contributed to the discovery of the Higgs Boson. Here we have glowing line particles that move in the designated shape of your chosen signed distance field (sdf). These are connected to the user's hands and as they move their hands through space the color of the visual effect changes. You can alternate the shapes asigned which will transition seemlesly from one to the next in line particle glowing animations.

  Make sure to take a copy of all files in the WU folder, prefab is pointing to both files within the folder and `.vfx` file is pointing to the signed distance field `.asset`  within folder.

#### visual graph preview

{/* table of associated components such as, assembly references, png's, exposed variables, scripts, shader graphs, shaders */}
#### exposed variables


| Name          | Description  | Type   | User controlled |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------ | --------------- |
| left hand position    | changes color of visual effect in relation to the position of the other hand    | transform  | yes      |
| right hand position    | changes color of visual effect in relation to the position of the other hand    | transform  | yes      |
| intensity    | changes length of lines, making the effect seem brighter or more subdued    | float  | no      |
| shape    | change the signed distance field creating the shape of the sdf, when these are alternated the vfx will transition between them in continuous animation  | texture3d   |  no     |
