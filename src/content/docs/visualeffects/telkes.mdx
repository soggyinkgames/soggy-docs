{/* vfx description */}
Inspired by Maria Telkes a biophysicist and inventor, also knows as `The sun queen` who's work led to the development of a photoelectric device to measure brain waves. An imense collection of particles which move in waves from the centre expanding out, connected to the user's hand movements.

{/* inventor story*/}
    <Card title="Telkes" icon="rocket">
    Biophysicist and inventor, born in Hungary, Maria Telkes’ accomplished career in solar energy research and development earned her the nickname “the Sun Queen.” Telkes earned her B.A. and Ph.D. from the University of Budapest. She had just become an instructor there when a 1924 visit to the United States changed her life. She relocated to Ohio the next year, joining the Cleveland Clinic Foundation as a biophysicist. Her work there with George Washington Crile, a distinguished surgeon, led to the development of a photoelectric device to measure brain waves.
