A package is not a builder, a package will contain a collection of assets and scripts of one type eg. visual effects, decals, shaders, etc. that can be imported into any game project.

<FileTree>

    - Assets .meta files not shown in documentation 
        - Art/
        - Audio/ if required
        - Settings/
        - Scripts/

## create a package

follow these steps    

<Steps>

1. open the appropiate soggy ink games builder's `packages` folder and add a folder for your new package. Name this folder `com.soggyinkgames.package-[add your package name here]`

2. cd into the created package project's directory

    ```bash
        cd com.soggyinkgames.package-soggyawesomepackage
    ```

3. instantiate git

    ```bash
        git init
    ```
4. add lfs, to handle large files 

    ```bash
        git install lfs
    ```

5. add .gitattributes file to root of project

    ```

    ```

6. add .gitignore file to root of project

    ```
    # This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project directory
    #
    # Get latest from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore

    # Temporary auto-generated Android Assets
    /[Aa]ssets/[Ss]treamingAssets/aa.meta
    /[Aa]ssets/[Ss]treamingAssets/aa/*

    ```
7. add package.json

    ```json

9. add to github

    <Aside type="note"> 
    all packages's names should be prefaced with `package` and have the work `soggy` in there
    eg `package-soggybuttholes`
    </Aside>


</Steps>


## package folder structure

All packages should start off looking something like this, give or take applicable folders for that specific type of package.

<FileTree>

    - Documentation/ .md file linking to this docs
    - Editor/ all editor related scripts
    - Runtime/ all assets and non editor scripts 
        - **MyAwesomeScripts.cs** THE PURPOSE OF THE PACKAGE
    - **MyAwesomeAssets** THE PURPOSE OF THE PACKAGE
        - AssetOne                
            - **AwesomeAsset.vfx**
            - AwesomeAsset.prefab
            - AwesomeAsset.asset 
            - …
        - …
    - …
    - Samples~/ the `~` line makes the folder invisible in unity
        - **SampleSoggyScene/** ADD AN EXAMPLE OF THE ASSETS IN ACTION
    - package.json
    - CHANGELOG.md
    - .gitattributes
    - .gitignore
    - LICENCE.md
    - README.md

</FileTree>

## versioning
three steps then test versioning with commit mesage

1. a folder called `.github`
2. in there add a folder called `workflows`
3. in that folder add a `.yml` file and name it `release`

    ```yml
        name: CI
        on:
            push:
                branches:
                - main
        jobs:
            release:
                name: release
                runs-on: ubuntu-latest
                steps:
                - uses: actions/checkout@v3
                with:
                    fetch-depth: 0
                - name: Release
                uses: cycjimmy/semantic-release-action@v3
                with:
                    extra_plugins: |
                        @semantic-release/changelog
                        @semantic-release/git
                    branch: main
                env:
                    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
