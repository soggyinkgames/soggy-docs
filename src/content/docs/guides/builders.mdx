A builder is not a package, however a builder contains all the assets and packages required to build and manage our packages. 

Each builder should only contain the assets and packages required for one specific category of works, eg visual effects, level design, etc.

## create a builder
follow these 7 steps


<Steps>
1. build a new project in unity hub and save locally to your machine

    <Aside type="note"> 
    all builder's names should be prefaced with `builder` and have the work `soggy` in there
    eg `builder-soggybuttholes`
    </Aside>

2. cd into the created project directory
3. instantiate git

    ```bash
        git init
    ```
4. add lfs, to handle large files 

    ```bash
        git lfs install
    ```

5. add .gitignore file to root of project

    ```
    # This .gitignore file should be placed at the root of your Unity project directory
    #
    # Get latest from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Unity.gitignore
    #
