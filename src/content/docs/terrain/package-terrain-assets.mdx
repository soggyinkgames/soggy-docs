When packaging assets in the appropiate builder couple of things to note

### package terrain assets

1. you'll want to include a few things in your terain package including 

    * a `terrain prefab`
    * a png of the `heightmap` used
    * the `terrain data` asset from the prefab (not a copy of it)
    * a `Layer Palette` scriptable object asset with 
    * each `layer` asset pointing to the 
    * `texture` png files

2. the file tree should look like this:

    <FileTree>

    - Documentation/ .md file linking to this docs
    - Editor/ all editor related scripts
    - Runtime/ all assets and non editor scripts 
        - MyAwesomeScripts.cs
      - **SoggyScenes** 
          - SampleSoggyScene.unity
      - **SoggyTerrains** 
          - LayerPalettes/
              - MyLayerPalette.asset *layer palette
              - layer1.terrainlayer  *layer
              - layer2.terrainlayer  *layer
          - Uluru             THE PURPOSE OF THE PACKAGE   
              - HeightMap_Uluru_10_857.png  *heightmap
              - Terrain_Uluru.prefab  *terrain prefab
              - Terrain_Uluru.asset   *terrain data
              - …
          - …
      - **SoggyTextures/** textures used by layers
      - com.soggyinkgames.package-soggyterrains.asmdef
    - …
    - Samples~/ the `~` line makes the folder invisible in unity
        - SampleSoggyScene/ add a scene showing assets
            - SampleSoggyScene.unity
    - package.json
    - CHANGELOG.md
    - .gitattributes
    - .gitignore
    - LICENCE.md
    - README.md

    </FileTree>

3. after creating your terrain from heightmaps, turn it into a prefab by dragging the terrain game object inside the terrain group `not the parent grouping game object` into your created folder and rename accordingly eg Uluru/`Terrain_Uluru`.prefab

4. open the prefab and add a `Layer Palette` and make sure each of the layers created go in your folder ^^ see above and that each of those layers when opened are pointing to the textures in your `Textures` folder, then press `SAVE` in the inspector

5. add prefabs to your scene and save scene under samples folder and in another folder under runtime.

    <Aside type="note"> 
     if an asset does not carry the textures across, double check you saved them all in the prefab not just in the game object in the scene
